            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-tt-dark-violet mb-3">1. Information We Collect (and Don't Collect)</h2>
            <p className="mb-2">We have designed our service to be used without the need for personal data.</p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 pl-4">
              <li>
                <strong>Prompt Information:</strong> We collect the text prompt you enter into our generator. This information is sent to our third-party AI provider (OpenRouter) to generate your tags. <strong>We do not log, store, or associate this prompt with you in any way after the request is completed.</strong> Your creative ideas remain your own.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Personal Information:</strong> We do not require you to create an account, and therefore we do not collect any personal information like your name, email address, or IP address.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Analytics Data:</strong> We use privacy-focused analytics (Google Analytics) to collect anonymous, aggregated data about website traffic, such as which pages are visited most often. This helps us improve the service. This data is not tied to any individual user.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Cookies:</strong> We use a single, essential cookie to remember your choice on our cookie consent banner. That's it. For more details, please see our <Link to="/legal/cookies" className="text-tt-medium-violet hover:underline font-medium">Cookie Policy</Link>.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-tt-dark-violet mb-3">3. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our tag generation is powered by the OpenRouter API. We send your prompt to their service for processing. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services, but we have chosen them for their commitment to robust data handling. We encourage you to review their policies.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-tt-dark-violet mb-3">4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We use administrative and technical security measures (like HTTPS) to protect data in transit. Since we do not store your prompts or personal data, the risk of a data breach is minimized.</p>
