Massive Performance Bottlenecks (JavaScript & Core Web Vitals):
The Problem: Huge JavaScript bundle (223 KiB unused), slow First/Largest Contentful Paint (3.4s/6.9s), and 2.2s of main thread blocking. Google heavily penalizes poor Core Web Vitals, directly impacting rankings and user experience.
Why it's Critical: This is the most fundamental issue. Even with great SEO content, if the site loads slowly, users bounce, and Google won't rank it highly. It's affecting all other efforts.
Prompt to fix: "Optimize JavaScript bundle size through code splitting and tree shaking. Defer non-critical JS and implement lazy loading for images to reduce main thread blocking. Improve Core Web Vitals to hit Google's recommended thresholds (<1.5s FCP, <2.5s LCP)."
Missing High-Value SEO Landing Pages:
The Problem: TurboTags is missing dedicated, keyword-optimized landing pages for core search terms like /youtube-hashtag-generator/, /instagram-hashtag-generator/, /tiktok-hashtag-generator/, /free-hashtag-generator/, etc.
Why it's Critical: This is the single biggest missed SEO opportunity, costing TurboTags over 50,000+ monthly searches from direct tool queries. You have the tool, but no front door for people searching for it.
Prompt to fix: "Immediately create dedicated, SEO-optimized landing pages for all missing high-value keyword phrases (e.g., 'Free YouTube Hashtag Generator 2025 - AI-Powered Tags'). Ensure each page has unique, rich content and relevant meta data."
Lack of Critical Security Headers:
The Problem: Missing Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Frame-Options header.
Why it's Critical: These are foundational for website security and trust. Their absence not only poses security risks but also negatively impacts trust signals with search engines and users, potentially affecting rankings.
Prompt to fix: "Implement essential HTTP security headers: Content-Security-Policy, HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Frame-Options to enhance site security and trust."
Inadequate Internal Linking Strategy:
The Problem: Blog content exists but lacks robust internal linking to the actual tool pages or newly created landing pages.
Why it's Critical: Internal links are crucial for distributing "link juice" (PageRank) across your site, helping search engines discover and understand your content hierarchy, and directing users to key conversion points (the tools).
Prompt to fix: "Develop and implement a comprehensive internal linking strategy, connecting blog posts to relevant tool landing pages and using keyword-rich anchor text to build authority."
Critical Accessibility Issues:
The Problem: Invalid ARIA attributes, non-sequential heading structure, and prohibited ARIA attributes detected.
Why it's Critical: Accessibility isn't just about inclusivity; it's a direct ranking factor for Google. Issues here can penalize your site's visibility and limit your audience reach.
Prompt to fix: "Rectify all identified accessibility issues, including correcting ARIA attribute values, ensuring a sequential heading structure, and removing prohibited ARIA attributes to improve overall site accessibility and SEO."
