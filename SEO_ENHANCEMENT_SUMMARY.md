### âœ… Current On-Page SEO Features

-   **Dynamic Meta Tags**: `usePageMeta` hook updates `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` for each page, ensuring relevant snippets in search results.
-   **Structured Data (JSON-LD)**:
    -   `WebSite` & `Organization`: Establishes the site's identity.
    -   `FAQPage`: Marks up the FAQ section for rich snippets.
    -   `BreadcrumbList`: Provides context to search engines about the page's location in the site hierarchy.
-   **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of `<h1>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` tags to structure content logically.
-   **Image `alt` Tags**: All significant images have descriptive alt text for accessibility and image search.
-   **Internal Linking**: Strategic internal links (e.g., in the blog, footer, and feature pages) help distribute page authority and guide users and crawlers.
-   **Clean, SEO-Friendly URLs**: Page slugs are readable and keyword-rich (e.g., `/youtube-hashtag-generator`).

### âœ… Current Technical SEO Features

-   **`humans.txt`**: Provides information about the creators and technology.
-   **HTTPS**: The entire site is served over a secure connection.
-g   **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes.

### ðŸš€ Future SEO Enhancements

-   **International SEO (`hreflang`)**: Implement `hreflang` tags to signal language and regional targeting for different versions of pages, especially for the tool pages. This would require dedicated URLs for each language (e.g., `turbotags.app/es/youtube-hashtag-generator`).
-   **Dynamic `BlogPosting` Schema**: Enhance the blog post pages with `BlogPosting` structured data to provide more detail (author, date published, etc.) for richer search results.
-   **Automated Backlink Monitoring**: Integrate a tool (e.g., Ahrefs API) to monitor backlink profile health.
-   **Core Web Vitals (CWV) Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring of CWV (LCP, FID, CLS) using Vercel Analytics or Google Search Console to proactively address performance issues.
-   **Image Optimization**: Implement a service like `imgix` or Cloudinary (or Vercel's Image Optimization) to serve next-gen image formats (like WebP/AVIF) and dynamically resize images. The current `img-wrapper.vercel.app` is a good start.
